# Human Computer Interaction @ NHN NEXT 2015

This is a final project for my HCI class at NHN NEXT. There was no restriction on selecting topic, except there must be an interaction between computer and human, and I chose tangible sketchbook using Arduino and Multi-touch screen. 

Literally, it's touch and draw project. You can touch a Multi-touch screen to choose colors, edit modes and to draw on LED matrix. There are four edit modes, which are drawing, reverting, deleting, and moving.
